# for the application to run correctly don't forget to update the two  dbcontext classes to the database because 
a conflict could happen if you tried to write "update-database"

#the right to to is to use '-context' like in the next lines>>>>
##1-"update-database -context ApplicationDbContext"
##2-"update-database -context DBContext"
